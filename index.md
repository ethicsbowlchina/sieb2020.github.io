### What is Ethics Bowl?  

![ethicsbowl.png](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/a11167d9gy1gb0wip8496j23af0sk135.jpg)


The Shanghai Interscholastic Ethics Bowl is a competitive yet collaborative event in which students discuss real-life ethical issues. In each round of competition, teams take turns analyzing cases about complex ethical dilemmas and responding to questions and comments from the other team and from a panel of judges. An ethics bowl differs from a debate competition in that students are not assigned opposing views; rather, they defend whichever position they think is correct, provide each other with constructive criticism, and win by demonstrating that they have thought rigorously and systematically about the cases and engaged respectfully and supportively with all participants. Data from surveys shows that this event teaches and promotes ethical awareness, critical thinking, civil discourse, civic engagement, and an appreciation for multiple points of view.

SIEB's goal is to do more than teach students how to think through ethical issues: It is to teach students how to think through ethical issues together, as fellow citizens in a complex moral and political community.

### What is the Shanghai Interscholastic Ethcis Bowl?

The Shanghai Interscholastic Ethics Bowl (SIEB) is the only known ethics bowl competition in China hosted at No.2 High School of East China Normal University. This year, the SIEB will become an official “International Affiliate” of the National High School Ethics Bowl (NHSEB), located in the US, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

### Who are the judges of the SIEB?

Most of our judges are graduated from top universities in the US. They are mostly are native speakers and professional teachers. They have diverse backgrounds, which should be highly recommended in the debate of ethics.

### New to the Ethics Bowl? No worries!

Every team participating in the SIEB will receive free online training by the NHSEB coaches (it’s official!) in the US. Experienced coaches of ethics bowl teams in the US will teach our participants ethics theories of different philosophers and how these theories can be applied to analyze real-life cases of ethics. They will provide an adequate amount of supplementary materials for our participants to read and discuss on. We take the training sessions seriously (even more seriously than the competition itself), since we understand so well that students generally learn the most before the match—during the discussions they have with their coach and among themselves. The match day is, to some extent, only a demonstration on how well the teams have been studying on those cases.

### Registration Fees?

The SIEB is totally free of charge, including the training sessions and the competition itself. (Well, actually the meals aren't included...) Our aim is to provide middle and high school students in China with the most fascinating experience in learning ethics and philosophy, while promoting “public” philosophy discussions and civic engagement through events like the SIEB.
